Algorithms intro

--------------------------------L1 : Welcome to Data Structures --------------------------------

What Is a Data Structure?
Data structures are just organizational tools that allow for more advanced algorithms.
What Is an Algorithm?
An "algorithm" is just a set of instructions that can be carried out to solve a problem.

--------------------------------L2 :  Find Minimum --------------------------------

Set minimum to positive infinity: float("inf").
If the list is empty, return None.
For each number in the list nums, compare it to minimum. If the number is smaller than minimum, set minimum to that number.
minimum is now set to the smallest number in the list. Return it.

--------------------------------L3, L4 : What is an Algorithms? --------------------------------

in the context of computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions. 
In short, an algorithm is:

Defined: there is a specific sequence of steps that performs a task
Unambiguous: there is a "correct" and "incorrect" interpretation of the steps
Implementable: it can be executed using software and hardware

--------------------------------L5 : Simple Algorithms--------------------------------

Algorithms, like anything else, can be understood by breaking them down piece by piece. 

Take a look at the following algorithm for adding two numbers--it's dead simple:
Start with input variables a and b
Add a and b using the + operator, and assign the result to a new variable, sum
Return the sum variable
