# Stacks

--------------------------------L1 : Stacks--------------------------------

A stack is a data structure that stores ordered items. It's like a list, but its design is more restrictive. 
It only allows items to be added or removed from the top of the stack:
Imagine a stack of plates: it's easy to take an item off the top of the stack, 
but you can't really get to the items in the middle or at the bottom without removing the items on top first.

stack referred to as a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure.
